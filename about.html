				<h3>About TetFuck, and the original Tetris®</h3>
				<h2>What is Tetris®?</h2>
				<h4>It’s the same, but addictive puzzle game that started it all!</h4>
				<p>By embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos, the Tetris® game provides intellectual sport that combines continuous fun with mental stimulation.

As one of the most recognizable and influential video game brands in the world, it’s no wonder why there are hundreds of millions of Tetris products being played, worn, and enjoyed by fans in their everyday lives. For almost forty years, the game and brand have truly transcended the barriers of culture and language, resulting in a fun and exciting playing experience for everyone, everywhere!</p>
				<h4>Bu- But what about TetFuck?</h4>
				<img src="img/about/tetfuck-screenshot_v2.png" alt="In-game screenshot of TetFuck. With Pussyo Pussyo block set, and backgrounds with load of brainrots."></img>
				<p>Well, the goal of <b>TetFuck</b>, is just to make fun of Tetris®, and the TetFun 2000 (the game that started all of this mod).

				TetFuck 2142 (and all of it’s upcoming sequel) retains the core mechanics of Tetris but injects a burst of energy and loads of cum with its funky soundtrack and vibrant, memes, sexy girls, disco-inspired, Broken visuals. The falling blocks sway to the beat, making each move feel like a dance move in a retro club. The traditional Russian folk tune that accompanied Tetris has been replaced with an infectious funkadelic, Nine Inch Nails amazing ear blasting soundtrack that elevates the gaming experience to new heights.</p>
				<p>Oh and we just recently unveiled The TetFuck Box, a collection that includes: TetFuck 2142, TetFuck 4K, and TetFuck V. Aswell as a new game called Kunny Krysis.
				<h4>How do you play?</h4>
				<p>The Tetris® game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop a procession of Tetriminos that fall into the rectangular Matrix at increasing speeds. Players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space, but if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over! It might sound simple, but strategy and speed can go a long way! Are YOU up for the challenge?

				With TetFuck, as we said before, it’s basically just Tetris but with all the stuff above, so the game should play exactly the same as before, super easy. You can adjust the keys sensitivity on the settings.

				TetFuck also support various controller through the use of Gopher360 (FREE, bundled with TetFuck), or reWASD (paid, with the TetFuck profile), both of these are located in TetFuck folder, example: C:\program files\tetfuck\Gopher360 or C:\program files\tetfuck\ReWASD config, with install/run instructions there.</p>
				<h4>How do you beat Pussyo Pussyo: Kunny Krysis?</h4>
				<p>The objective of Pussyo Pussyo is to clear your board of Pussyos before your opponent does. Pussyos are colored blobs that fall from the top of the screen and can be connected to each other in horizontal or vertical lines. When a line of four or more Pussyos is connected, it is cleared from the board and the player scores points.

The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Pussyos fall from the top of the screen and land on the grid. Players can rotate and move Pussyos to create matches of four or more. When a match is made, the Pussyos are cleared from the board and the player scores points.

The game ends when one player clears all of the Pussyos from their board. The player with the most points wins, and the loser would have to FISTFUCK somebody and get pregnant.</p>
				<h4>Who Created Tetris®?</h4>
				<p>In 1984, Tetris® was born from the imagination of computer programmer Alexey Pajitnov. Inspired by his favorite puzzle board game, Pentominos, Pajitnov created an electronic game that let players arrange puzzle pieces in real time as they fell from the top of the playing field. The resulting design was a game that used seven distinctive geometric playing pieces, each made up of four squares. Pajitnov called this game “Tetris,” a combination of “tetra” (the Greek word meaning “four”) and “tennis” (his favorite sport).</p>
				<h4>Who the fucking nigger made TetFuck?</h4>
				<p>In 2024, 40 years after the original Tetris® was born, a anonymous couple have sex together and that guy cummed into a HDD/SSD that contains TetFun 2000. Both his wife and his fucking motherboard got pregnant, but we don’t talk about the former, that motherboard suddenly stops working, so instead of buying a new PC, he decided to sent that motherboard to a guy who only known as “leonidakarlach”, our current CEO of TetFuck Company, 
				along with his fucking entire PC including semen filled HDD, we put his HDD in and we found out that his copy of TetFun 2000 suddenly turning into TetFuck 2142 after we trying to relaunch it, so now we start building and adding more awesome <a href="https://youtube.com/@NIN">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@Metallica">Metallica</a>, various other musicians, <a href="https://swgcoolarticles.wordpress.com/2024/03/09/skibidi-toilet-heat-groovy-adventures-in-radio-heads-quirky-realm/">Skibidi Toilet Heat</a>, <a href="https://swgcoolarticles.wordpress.com/2024/03/09/the-emergence-of-minecraft-r34-a-fusion-of-minecraft-and-roblox-content/">“Minecraft R34”</a>, <a href="https://swgcoolarticles.wordpress.com/2024/03/09/furry-on-car-good-or-bad/">Furry have sex on Car</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqoH1XcvnLQ">much more…</a></p>

				<h2>The Tetris® and the TetFucking Effect</h2>
				<p>The Tetris® Effect is a catchy term that players use to describe the way they are inspired by the game and see Tetriminos in everyday situations. Because Tetris, like the real world, challenges players to make order out of chaos using a specific organization system, the game components translate easily into lifestyle interpretations. Whether you’re packing the trunk of your car, loading a dishwasher, or organizing your shelves, you’re likely thinking about how each object will fit together strategically with minimal empty space. This is the Tetris Effect!
